# T2 Arch Arkdep

** insert 1990s under construction gif **


Toolkit for building, deploying and maintaining an immutable, btrfs-based, multi-root system.

Arkdep is the set of tools providing immutability to Arkane Linux. It attempts to differentiate itself from other similar tools by being "stupidly simple", hackable, flexible, and having the usability of the tooling be a top priority.

> [!NOTE]
> Arkdep is still in active development, breaking changes might still happen as the project moves toward stable. The current codebase has also yet to be thoroughly tested, there may be lingering bugs or other issues
